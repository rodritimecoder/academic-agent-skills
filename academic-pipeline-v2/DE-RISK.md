                        automatic fallback
    stats               Display performance, accuracy, and dollar savings
                        metrics
    harvest             Inspect harvested evaluation failures for calibration

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```

## Command 3

    hash space. Vectors from different spaces are not comparable, so every
    embedded row records which space it came from and `get` skips the rest

## What a CI runner with no credentials and no GPUs cannot verify

- **`zoom_download.py --help` did not even reach its argument parser.** It fails
  at `import requests` with `ModuleNotFoundError`. That is a dependency problem,
  not an invocation contract. A bare CI runner can confirm the failure mode, but
  it cannot verify whether the script's actual CLI supports transcript/keyframe
  fetching until `requests` (and its other imports) are installed and the script
  executes. The transcript/keyframe mode is therefore still **unverified**.
- **`eval_router.py --help` is verifiable** without credentials or GPUs: it
  printed its real subcommand set (`route`, `exec`, `stats`, `harvest`). What a
  no-credential runner **cannot** verify is any `exec`/`route` run that actually
  dispatches to local models (ports 8080/8083) or OpenRouter, because those need
  the GPUs/live services and an API key respectively.
- **`cache_engine.py` can be opened and read** (it is a library, not a CLI). A
  no-GPU runner cannot verify the semantic cache behavior, because its
  `LocalEmbedder` targets `:8087/v1/embeddings` and only the labelled offline
  fallback path would run without that embedding slot.
- **`ports.py list` describes the GPU box**, including the Qwen3.6-35B-A3B local
  model on port 8080 and the decision slot on port 8083, but a CI runner with no
  GPUs cannot verify any of those cards are actually loaded or responsive.
